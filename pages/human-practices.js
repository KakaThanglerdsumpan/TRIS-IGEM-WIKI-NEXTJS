          The first professor that we interviewed was Dr. Theerapat
          Luangsuphabool and his team from the Biotechnology Research and
          Development Office, Department of Agriculture. From this interview, we
          were able to gain incredibly insightful feedback about our project and
          the things that we should consider when making the antimicrobial
          peptides an actual product. He brought up the fact that proteins need
          specific conditions to work, so we need to be careful about the
          conditions that the peptide will be used in, since it could denature
          at high temperatures. Considering Thailand&apos;s warm climate, this
          perspective was very beneficial.

          The second professor that we interviewed was Dr. Karsidete
          Teeranitayatarn from the research and development team at Molena and
          Green Innovative Biotechnology. He specializes in food safety, food
          security, and sustainable agriculture. From the interview, we learned
          of the significant threat that bacterial wilt is, especially in
          Thailand and southeast Asian countries alike. We discovered traces of
          pesticides in the food we eat, which are causes of diseases such as
          cancer. He also noted that organic pesticides might not take effect as
          fast as chemical pesticides, so the consistent use of our
          antimicrobial peptide will be needed in order to see noticeable
          results.
          <b>
            {" "}
            From this, we decided that if the product were to be used in real
            life, it would need to be applied to the crop regularly, unlike
            chemical pesticides.
          </b>{" "}
          Furthermore, the company that he works for is also manufacturing herb
          extracts to combat against plant pathogenic bacteria, so he will be
          very beneficial to the development of our research. He also gave
          insight on how consumers are often willing to pay more in order to
          feel safer about the food that they eat. Considering this, the change
          in price of crops from the shift of chemical pesticides to our
          antimicrobial peptide will not be an issue for people in terms of
          price.

            The interview that we conducted with Dr. Pimsiri, enabled us to
            learn that it is better to have multiple techniques working together
            to solve the problem, rather than a single technique, in order to
            ensure the best results.

          From this interview, Dr. Pimsiri shared her knowledge about the

          how <i>Ralstonia</i> is able to easily spread from one plant to
          another. In fact, the bacteria can spread simply by using the same
          scissors that were used to cut infected plants to cut uninfected
          plants. It can even spread through water irrigation systems. In order
          to combat this, she suggested that we use a combination of various

          by our product, his insight on the issues we are trying to solve will
          be very beneficial. He has experienced major problems with bacterial
          wilt in one of his fields where he grows pepper. Mr. Kasem told us
          that he started growing peppers two years ago, in which he experienced
          success only in the first year, with around 10% of the crops being
          affected by bacterial wilt. However, during the second year, that
          proportion had risen to 100% causing him to lose all 30,000 THB that
          he had invested into his field. He also mentioned that there is no
          current solution to this, as the chemicals that he has been given by
          the district agricultural officer are inadequate due to them not
          understanding bacterial wilt completely. Having not received any
          profits back from his investment, Mr. Kaseem also revealed that he
          felt discouraged in his efforts to grow pepper.

          Mr. Yutthana Klinsukhon is another farmer that we had the pleasure of
          interviewing. During this meeting, we learned about a new medium of
          how pesticides are being used. He taught us how drones can be used to
          spray pesticides on crops, eliminating the problem of the pesticide
          exposure on farmers. Our antimicrobial peptide, contrary to commercial
          pesticides, does not result in any harm, allowing farmers to also not
          have to worry about financial troubles when trying to afford drones. A
          downside of drones, however, is that they are incapable of spraying
          pesticides in a highly concentrated fashion. This leaves zones that
          are particularly condensed with pests only susceptible to pesticides
          sprayed by farmers themselves. Furthermore, we learned about how
          people will doubt the safety of our product, since it is a product of
          synthetic biology, which is something that Thai people still have a
          negative stigma towards. Furthermore, concerns about synthetic biology
          were brought up, since many Thai people are still skeptical about the
          safety of modified organisms. He mentioned that in order to make
          people trust in our product, we should educate them, and get an
          endorsement from the government.

        <p class="indented1">
          Calling all the way from Khao Yai, we got to interview Ms. Kate
          Bhasamol through Zoom. Ms. Kate is the manager of an agricultural
          business in Khao Yai, where she takes care of the farms that the
          business owns. Being a business, the money they use and receive needs
          to be carefully thought through. Since chemical pesticides are much
          cheaper than organic pesticides, they opted for the former, as it is
          better to use them than to lose all their crops. To our surprise, she
          disagreed with Dr. Karsidete’s opinion of how although there are
          certain groups of people who are willing to pay more money for organic
          crops, most people in Thailand would choose the cheaper option over
          the healthier option. In order to find out what consumers actually
          think, we decided to conduct a survey at a local market called
          Sammakorn. Additionally, similar to what Dr. Karsidete said, Ms. Kate
          agreed that organic pesticides have a slower effect on crops compared
          to chemical pesticides. Furthermore, chemical pesticides make the
          crops look nicer, while organic pesticides leave minimal aesthetic
          flaws. This could lead consumers to think that chemical pesticides are
          better.

            Since we were planning to conduct a public survey at a local market,

        <p class="indented1">
          The Human Practices team decided to conduct surveys on stalls at the
          Sammakorn market in order to gain more insight from the businesses
          themselves. After surveying many different stalls, we saw a common
          pattern: all the stalls either said that they do not use chemical
          pesticides, or that they were unaware; no stalls were determined they
          used chemical pesticides. They also mentioned how customers do care
          about whether or not chemical pesticides are used, and that consumers
          are willing to pay more for produce that is grown organically. Thus,
          it can be assumed that people are aware of the negative effects of
          pesticides, and safety is prioritized over pricing. Additionally, as
          Ms. Kate had mentioned, produce grown by organic farming will have
          some small imperfections unlike those grown with chemical pesticides,
          which can be seen in most of the stalls. However, there were some
          stalls that looked a bit suspicious, since all their crops looked
          perfect, without any bite marks from worms or insects at all. This
          could mean that the stalls lied about the use of chemical pesticides,
          they genuinely do not know, or maybe it really was organic farming.
          <b>
            {" "}
            We believe that all of these stalls have to promote their products
            as organic in order to be able to sell to their customers, even if
            some may not be completely true, since there was no way for
            customers to prove that they were lying.

        <p class="indented1">
          At the Sammakorn market, we were able to survey a total of 15 people
          who belong to the consumer stakeholder group. The main takeaway from
          this was that their main priority when buying fruits and vegetables is
          the quality of the produce, which includes whether or not pesticides
          are used to grow them or not. Furthermore, they also mentioned that
          income is also a very important factor when choosing what to buy. When
          the income is low, people often prioritize the price of the product
          over its quality, and when the income is high, the opposite is true.
          Additionally, there were mixed opinions about the use of synthetic
          biology to create an alternative to pesticides. Some people said that
          they supported synthetic biology, while others were completely against
          it. Their opinions about synthetic biology seem to be split in half,
          with half of the people supporting synthetic biology and the other
          half going against synthetic biology. Since this was a small sample,

          public’s opinions on the use of pesticides and synthetic biology. From
          the survey, we were able to collect data from a total of 511 people.

          collecting their information, while also making sure that all
          responses were anonymous. From the 511 people who filled out the
          google form, 83% were adults who are already working. This means that
          the conclusions drawn from this google form will be most applicable to
          Thai adults.

          95.7% of the respondents said that they do know of the detrimental
          effects of pesticides on themselves, while 3.9% said that they do not,

          affected the environment negatively. On the other hand, only 1.8% said
          that they did not and 0.2% said “other”. This suggests that most

          For the next question, 90.8% of the people that did the google form
          agreed that the negative effects of pesticides molded and impacted the
          way that they view agriculture practices. 8.4% answered no, while the
          other 0.8% answered others.

          Worryingly, only ~55% of the respondents would prefer a synthetic
          pesticide over chemical pesticides, meaning almost half of them are
          unsure about the use of synthetic biology. Even though most of the
          people doing this google form are aware of the negative effects of
          pesticides, nearly half of those people are still doubting synthetic
          biology.

            From this, we have realized that what Mr. Yutthana said was true,
            and educating people about synthetic biology should be one of the
            main goals of our project.

          A total of 435 out of 511 people said that they do think finding an
          alternative to pesticides is of utmost importance, which makes up a
          total of 85.1%. Although there is still a small number of people who
          do not think that an alternative to pesticides is important, the
          majority of the people do. Relating back to the previous question,
          this means that people do care about finding an alternative to
          pesticides, but half of them do not think that synthetic biology is
          the answer.

            This demonstrates the need to change the negative stigma against
            synthetic biology in Thailand.

          Lastly, when people were asked whether or not the price of crops
          affected their decision of choosing pesticides or not, 86.3% of the
          people said that they would rather pay more in order to buy a product
          that has not been exposed to pesticides.

            This was the same information that we received from our local survey
            at Sammakorn, so we are able to conclude that price is not a problem
            for people in Thailand, as long as they are able to gain access to
            an option safer than pesticides.

          We believe that we have done our part in “closing the loop”. We have
          interacted with all three groups of stakeholders in order to make sure
          that our product is adjusted according to the needs of these three
          groups. From the feedback that we have gotten from the professors, the
          businesses, the farmers, and the consumers, we were able to adjust our
          project accordingly. We realize that their needs need to be
          prioritized, since they were the people who will be affected by our
          work the most.

          Since our project was done during the COVID-19 pandemic, we practiced
          different measures meant to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. During
          the lab, masks were worn at all times both inside and also outside.
          Masks were also only used once and thrown away after we had finished
          using them. Additionally, we frequently washed our hands to help
          prevent the spread of the virus.

          The aim of our experiment was to come up with a modified peptide that
          produces Bombolitin in order to combat the <i>Ralstonia</i> bacteria
          in crops. To do this, <i>E. coli</i> was genetically modified to be
          capable of producing Bombilitin. Our project was kept at a prototype
          stage and there was no actual plant experimentation.

          All members of the Thailand_RIS team had proper training on how to
          correctly use the lab equipment at both labs. We also learned how to
          deal with possible emergencies and malfunctions in equipment. We
          rigorously followed 10 main lab safety rules at all times. Knowing
          that Ralstonia can be harmful to the surrounding flora since it is an
          infectious bacteria, we took extra careful measures when dealing with
          the bacteria.

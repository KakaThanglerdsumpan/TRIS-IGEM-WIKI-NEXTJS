            The final results from both biopanning and ELISA that we received from Kasetsart University are arranged to be provided for future iGEM teams. 

In our test to find the most specific nanobody that binds with the solanacearum, we were able to identify it out of the 20 PBS clones.

 We were able to demonstrate more effective use of both TB1 and HB2151. Future teams could implement this technique to make biopanning even more effective. 

Another advantage of our technique was the use of Tween-20 which acts as a detergent to decrease background staining. 

The phosphate-buffered saline solution that we used and calculated could be used for future teams to get the highest yield of specific nanobodies. 

Finally, our peptide can also be utilized by future teams.

        Ligation is an important step when working with transformation. Ligation is the process of incubating DNA sequences together to allow for a vector and an insert to be united. The ratio of ligation is also of the utmost importance since it determines whether or not the vector and insert will be able to unite with one another. In our case at the lab, the initial ratio was 3:5 between vector to insert, however, throughout cloning, we discovered that this ratio did not work. This led us to try a different ratio of 1:2 between vector and insert, which eventually worked.

        <b>Background:</b><br/>
Similarly to what the 2019 Madrid team proposed, this part holds potential to be used in other ways of separation. For our experiment, the Histidine tag was used as a part of purification through His column. Since Histidine contains polar properties, metal ions such as Ni2+ or Cu2+, will attract the histidine and allow for bonds to form. 

This attraction will form strong bonds that will cause the His-tags to form bonds with the linings on the side of the column, allowing for washing of surplus proteins, without losing our target protein.

        <b>Experiment:</b> <br/>
For our experiment, we had to undergo sonication to remove our protein from the host cell itself. However, when sonication occurs, even though the host cell is destroyed and proteins are free, all of the proteins are merged together. Thus, we had to separate our target protein from the rest of the proteins that kept the cells functioning. To accomplish this, we had to depend upon the His-tags. Within the amino acids of our peptide sequence Histidine which contains polar properties. With this, we decided to use His-columns, columns that are lined on the edges with metal ions, to separate our target protein from the rest. The histidine within our protein sequence will be attracted to the metal ions on the sides of the column due to the bonds that will be formed between the Histidine and metal ions. Since the other protein doesnâ€™t contain Histidine in its sequences, no bonding will occur which will cause it to continually float in the solution mixture, separating it from our target protein. As we wash away the solution mixture, none of our target protein will be removed since it's still bonded to the sides. Afterwards, we wash the column with imidazole, eluting the protein. The imidazole is capable of eluting the protein since it competes with the histidine to bind with the metal ions lining the his columns.

            The final results from both biopanning and ELISA that we received from Kasetsart University are arranged to be provided for 
            future iGEM teams. In our test to find the most specific nanobody that binds with the solanacearum, we were able to identify 
            it out of the 20 PBS clones. We were able to demonstrate more effective use of both TB1 and HB2151. Future teams could implement 
            this technique to make biopanning even more effective. Another advantage of our technique was the use of 
            Tween-20 which acts as a detergent to decrease background staining. The phosphate-buffered saline solution that we used and calculated could be used for future teams to get the highest 
            yield of specific nanobodies. Finally, our peptide can also be utilized by future teams.

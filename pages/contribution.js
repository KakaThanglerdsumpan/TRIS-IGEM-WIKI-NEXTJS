            The final results from both biopanning and ELISA that we received from Kasetsart University are arranged to be provided for future iGEM teams. 

In our test to find the most specific nanobody that binds with the solanacearum, we were able to identify it out of the 20 PBS clones.

 We were able to demonstrate more effective use of both TB1 and HB2151. Future teams could implement this technique to make biopanning even more effective. 

Another advantage of our technique was the use of Tween-20 which acts as a detergent to decrease background staining. 

The phosphate-buffered saline solution that we used and calculated could be used for future teams to get the highest yield of specific nanobodies. 

Finally, our peptide can also be utilized by future teams.

        Ligation is an important step when working with transformation. Ligation is the process of incubating DNA sequences together to allow for a vector and an insert to be united. The ratio of ligation is also of the utmost importance since it determines whether or not the vector and insert will be able to unite with one another. In our case at the lab, the initial ratio was 3:5 between vector to insert, however, throughout cloning, we discovered that this ratio did not work. This led us to try a different ratio of 1:2 between vector and insert, which eventually worked.

                    Agriculture is a body of work that depends heavily upon the
                    use of pesticides. No matter how efficient pesticides may
                    be, the chemicals that are permeated through its application
                    can cause severe issues to both humans and the environment.
                    Chemicals present in pesticides, such as paraquat, have
                    shown a direct negative impact upon the consumer when
                    directly ingested. These chemicals can cause a variety of
                    diseases including heart failure, kidney failure, and liver
                    scarring. Alongside these unintended side effects on humans,
                    these chemicals also have the capacity to pollute the
                    surrounding environment, wreaking havoc upon the ecosystem
                    of soils, causing a drop in soil efficiency, subsequently
                    lowering crop yield. Thailand, being a country that depends
                    on an agricultural based economy, relies heavily upon the
                    usage of pesticides. Especially with the rapid economic
                    development Thailand has undergone in the past few decades,
                    our agricultural industry continues to grow swiftly. This
                    growth is hastened by pesticide utilization, as the usage
                    has increased significantly over these couple of decades.
                    This startling increase is a cause of concern seeing as more
                    farmers and workers are exposed to the harmful chemicals.
                    Thus, alternatives to these pesticides must quickly be found
                    before further damage is done to the agricultural community
                    and the environment that surrounds the farmlands.

                    On the topic of pesticides, the majority of the general
                    public think of pesticide as anti-insect, which is only
                    correct to a certain extent. Insects and pests aren’t the
                    only two problems faced when trying to keep crops healthy.
                    Alongside these two hindrances, farmers also have to deal
                    with bacteria that is capable of causing infectious diseases
                    on plants.
                    <i> Ralstonia solanacearum </i>, is an example of these
                    disease-causing bacterias. Bacterial wilt, a disease caused
                    by
                    <i> R. solanacearum </i>, is a fatal infection that affects
                    water uptake of the plant, causing malnutrition and
                    eventually death within the crop. Alongside this malignant
                    effect, bacterial wilt is easily spreadable throughout
                    entire fields, making it extremely detrimental towards
                    farmlands if not contained properly and immediately.
                    Bacterial wilt is an example of why pesticides are so
                    crucial. Without the help of pesticides, containment of
                    plant infections would be exceedingly difficult which could
                    result in large losses of crop yield. On one hand, this may
                    highlight the significance of pesticides, but it also shows
                    how overly dependent and reliant we have to be on the usage
                    of these chemicals. Knowing this, we must find a more
                    sustainable and safer alternative for pesticides that can
                    yield the same results.

                    Most cells are protected and regulated through a
                    phospholipid bilayer. This bilayer acts as the cell’s shield
                    and fence, inhibiting certain objects from entering, while
                    also holding the shape of the cell together. Bombolitin
                    holds the ability to interact with this phospholipid
                    bilayer, allowing for disruption within the cell and
                    eventually cell lysis. This holds especially true for cell
                    membranes with more negative charges, specifically{' '}
                    <i>Ralstonia</i>. Since <i>Ralstonia</i> contains a
                    negatively charged cell membrane, the positively charged
                    bombolitin will be attracted to the membrane of the{' '}
                    <i>Ralstonia</i>, allowing the peptide to interact with the
                    lipid bilayer of the bacteria. These interactions will
                    result in the aforementioned cell membrane disruption and
                    lysis, making bombolitin capable of inhibiting{' '}
                    <i>Ralstonia</i> activity. This capability allows bombolitin
                    to be a potential safer alternative to pesticides when
                    targeting <i>R. Solanacearum</i>.

                <p className="indented1">
                    Having said that, one main issue is the production of
                    bombolitin. Prior techniques of production entails
                    harvesting the bombolitin from bee venom itself, however,
                    this is extremely costly and inefficient as it doesn’t yield
                    the necessary amount of peptide. Hence, our goal is to find
                    a way to directly express the bombolitin genome sequence via
                    synthetic biology. Through various steps of digestion,
                    ligation, and transformation, we’ll use competent cells to
                    explicitly produce bombolitin enabling more efficient
                    production of the peptide itself.

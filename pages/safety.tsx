                    Since our project was done during the COVID-19 pandemic, we
                    practiced different measures meant to help reduce the spread
                    of COVID-19. During the lab, masks were worn at all times
                    both inside and also outside. Masks were also only used once
                    and thrown away after we had finished using them.
                    Additionally, we frequently washed our hands to help prevent
                    the spread of the virus.

                    <i>Ralstonia</i> bacteria in crops. To do this,{' '}

                    All members of the Thailand_RIS team had proper training on
                    how to correctly use the lab equipment at both labs. We also
                    learned how to deal with possible emergencies and
                    malfunctions in equipment. We rigorously followed 10 main
                    lab safety rules at all times. Knowing that Ralstonia can be
                    harmful to the surrounding flora since it is an infectious
                    bacteria, we took extra careful measures when dealing with
                    the bacteria.

                    When discussing the possibility of developing the modified
                    bombolitin into a product, effectiveness and viability of
                    the final product have to be considered.

                    Firstly, taking into account that our potential product will
                    be mainly consisting of peptides, there are specific
                    temperatures and pH levels that need to be addressed. In
                    order for the product to be effective, the peptide cannot
                    denature. In response, heat shock proteins such as Hsp 60
                    can potentially prevent the denaturation of the peptide.
                    Additionally, specified use of time for the ideal
                    temperature will also be identified. However, further
                    testing is required before finalizing all components.

                    Secondly, shelf life could be a big challenge if the
                    modified bombolitin were to be developed into a product.
                    When kept at room temperature, peptides could degrade within
                    24 hours, and -20°C is preferred for long term storage.
                    However, -20°C might not be practical for the majority of
                    farmers, since they would need constant access to a freezer.

                    Finally, we have to consider commercial usage.
                    Statistically, the demand of the product should be high.
                    However, farmers may be skeptical of a genetically modified
                    product which would significantly lower the demand. This may
                    be solved through educating local farmers about genetically
                    modified products and the effectiveness of said product.
                    Additionally, the costs of production and the selling price
                    of the product has to be determined. As we know, because of
                    the way the product is being produced, through synthetic
                    biology, the initial cost of the production would be high.
                    Due to this, we would have to find a profitable competitive
                    price for the potential product which would very well be
                    more expensive than commercial chemical pesticides.

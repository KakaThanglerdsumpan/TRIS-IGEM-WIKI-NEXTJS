                <t/>iGEM Tec-Chihuahua reached out to us via Instagram inviting us to join their “Comic Coloring Book” Project. This collaboration project incorporated both human practices and educational outreach. Each team created a 2-page long English colorless comic book centered around their iGEM project. These comic books were then compiled all together and distributed by iGEM Tec-Chihuahua to elementary and middle school students, aged 6-12. Our team had a lot of fun creating a story that conveyed our project. While creating the comic, we had to be thoughtful of the target audience. Keeping in mind that we were trying to engage young kids with limited scientific knowledge, we made the drawings entertaining and kept it simple. In our opinion, this was a very unique project that helped young kids learn about synthetic biology, current problems in the world, and the application of synthetic biology. When we received the compilation of all the completed comics, we were mesmerized by the wide variety of art styles and we greatly enjoyed learning about other team’s projects in such a manner. In fact, the comic book that we created was used as part of our educational outreach with third graders at our school, and the students had a lot of fun coloring the book and reading the exciting, yet educational story.

          <b>Description:</b> Bombolitin is a naturally occurring peptide that
          can be found as a component within bumblebee venom. The peptide itself
          is a positively charged molecule, allowing it to interact with
          negatively charged cell membranes of bacterial organisms. This
          interaction will cause cell lysis in most bacterial cells, including
          both gram negative and positive bacterias. This quality of the peptide
          has allowed it to be considered an antimicrobial peptide, making it an
          attractive molecule for agricultural applications. The sequence of
          bombolitin is LNLKKILGKIGVMLS. Its net charge is +4, hydrophobic ratio
          is 50%, and GRAVY Index 0.58.

          modified bombolitin, three additional amino acids, phenylalanine,
          leucine, and tryptophan, were added to the end of the sequence. The
          sequence is LNLKKILGKIGVMLSHLNLLL. Its net charge is +3.25,
          hydrophobic ratio is 55%, and GRAVY Index is 0.91.

          of the bombolitin, three additional FFF amino acids were added to the

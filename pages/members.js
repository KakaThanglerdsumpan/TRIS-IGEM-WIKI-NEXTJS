                In 2019, Ruamrudee International School participated in 
                iGEM for the first time. I was thrilled, therefore, when 
                a second team emerged post-COVID, and asked if I would be one 
                of their advisers for iGEM 2022. Thailand_RIS is excited to deliver 
                on more aspects of the competition and has challenged themselves in
                 both the science and communication. I have had the pleasure of
                  working closely with most team members in my Biology and TOK 
                  classes over the past three years, so it is lovely to see their
                   growth. As IB DP Coordinator at RIS, I see this opportunity as 
                   a demonstration of inquiry and risk taking, two aspects of the 
                   IB Learner Profile. I look forward to hearing the team&#39;s 
                   presentation in Paris, discussing areas of success and growth 
                   and continuing the conversation back at RIS to support a future
                    iGEM team.

              My name is Olivier Fernandez, I am a French national living, 
              working and teaching at Ruamrudee International School 
              in Bangkok - Thailand for over 30 years. I taught French as 
              a Foreign Language in middle school, French IB Ab Initio in 
              high school, and Values Education in 3 divisions ES, MS and HS. 
              I am currently teaching Values in middle school as well as Ethics 
              and Peace Studies in high school. I embarked as a Logistic Coordinator 
              to assist Mrs. Nicole Sabet but also due to the fact that I 
              am &quot;a Parisien&quot; and I know Paris very well.  I am proud and delighted 
              to bring RIS students to the City of Lights: Paris and get the group 
              exposed to French Culture, Arts and Food. Bienvenue en France!

                Dr. Alisa Vangnai is a professor at the Department of Biochemistry,
                 Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University. She received her B.Sc 
                 and M.Sc from Chulalongkorn University and her PhD from Oregon State 
                 University. Her research focuses on environmental and industrial 
                 biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioremediation. She provided 
                 us with crucial guidance and assistance on protein modification,
                  expression, purification, and toxicity testing, as well as 
                  providing us with the lab space and equipment to do so. Moreover, 
                  Dr. Vangnai connected us with several stakeholders which we were 
                  able to interview. Team Thailand_RIS would like to extend our 
                  deepest gratitude to her for her invaluable help on this project.

                In 2019, Ruamrudee International School participated in 
                iGEM for the first time. I was thrilled, therefore, when 
                a second team emerged post-COVID, and asked if I would be one 
                of their advisers for iGEM 2022. Thailand_RIS is excited to deliver 
                on more aspects of the competition and has challenged themselves in
                 both the science and communication. I have had the pleasure of
                  working closely with most team members in my Biology and TOK 
                  classes over the past three years, so it is lovely to see their
                   growth. As IB DP Coordinator at RIS, I see this opportunity as 
                   a demonstration of inquiry and risk taking, two aspects of the 
                   IB Learner Profile. I look forward to hearing the team&#39;s 
                   presentation in Paris, discussing areas of success and growth 
                   and continuing the conversation back at RIS to support a future
                    iGEM team.

              My name is Olivier Fernandez, I am a French national living, 
              working and teaching at Ruamrudee International School 
              in Bangkok - Thailand for over 30 years. I taught French as 
              a Foreign Language in middle school, French IB Ab Initio in 
              high school, and Values Education in 3 divisions ES, MS and HS. 
              I am currently teaching Values in middle school as well as Ethics 
              and Peace Studies in high school. I embarked as a Logistic Coordinator 
              to assist Mrs. Nicole Sabet but also due to the fact that I 
              am &quot;a Parisien&quot; and I know Paris very well.  I am proud and delighted 
              to bring RIS students to the City of Lights: Paris and get the group 
              exposed to French Culture, Arts and Food. Bienvenue en France!

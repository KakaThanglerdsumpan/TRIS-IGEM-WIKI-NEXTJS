                        As we are a first time high school team, we were hoping to get some feedback and guidance in the early stages of iGEM from a more experienced university team. When we reached out to the Stanford iGEM team, they were interested to collaborate with us and provide guidance, so we were able to set up a virtual meeting with them. We kicked off the meeting by presenting our projects to each other. Afterwards, we discussed some of the struggles that we currently had. Given the topics we shared, the Stanford team felt that they had the interest capacity to help us with these struggles and uncertainties, so they offered to mentor us via regular meetings throughout the iGEM journey providing help, guidance, and feedback. Additionally, they were also available through direct messaging to answer any questions we had. After this meeting, both of us talked to the rest of our team members and agreed to form a mentorship together, with regular meetings to check in on our progress and streamlined communication through Instagram Direct Messaging.

                        The mentorship with Stanford played a significant role in choosing the path of modeling and the development of our wiki. During the early stages of the mentorship, our team was unsure on how to approach the building of our wiki page. Knowing this, Stanford, with their superior skills in programming applications, aided us by providing examples on how they went about their wiki. Furthermore, throughout the progression of our wiki, Stanford offered answers to any simple questions we had, and was willing to attend meetings where they would help us troubleshoot any problems encountered. Moreover, we had difficulties understanding what qualified as a proper model, so we requested help from Stanford and they promptly delivered. They gave us feedback on our current model at that time, while also prompting us to reconsider certain aspects of models. The team helped explain to us what exactly models were and why they are used. From this, we realized that we had already been using models in our regular labs. Finally, when our team was having issues finding and understanding the procedures for uploading parts, Stanford assisted us by guiding us through the uploading process and helped clarify a few of the misconceptions we had regarding parts. The Stanford team was extremely helpful and pivotal towards our whole iGem process.

                        Seeing that the GEMS Taiwan team was working on an agriculture-related project, we reached out to them with the intent of promoting our Synbio for Agricultural Team meetup. While they were not able to attend the meeting due to scheduling conflicts, we decided to have an external virtual meeting to discuss our projects. Our initial meeting with GEMS Taiwan began by each team presenting their respective projects. 
                        We realized that we were both high school teams working on a very similar project, so we felt that we would be able to support each other on both the science and the navigation of iGEM while being in high school. From this point forward, we met with GEMS Taiwan through several, regular meetings to give updates and suggestions on the progress of our project, as well as to work on our long term collaboration project:
                        the Infographic Exchange Project. We also communicated 
                        regularly through Instagram DMs for quick questions and updates. Overall, 
                        this partnership was incredibly beneficial to us and was essential to both of our team&#39;s projects and initiatives.

                Throughout our valuable partnership with GEMS Taiwan, our team focussed mainly on these aspects: 
                collaboration, human practices, implementation, and design. For collaboration, 
                our job was to organize, translate, and distribute for the Infographic Exchange Project. 
                Although they could not attend, GEMS_Taiwan also helped to promote our Synbio for Agriculture 
                Team Meetup. Since we had similar target audiences for our product 
                (i.e the farming industry), we had many meaningful discussions regarding human practices. 
                For example, we shared the different experiences we had collecting data, from surveying 
                the market we went to, to the reaction from farmers, farming companies, and agricultural 
                regulators. This exchange was beneficial to both of our teams since we could learn and hear from a wider perspective, as well as also being very interesting to see how the regulations 
                and reactions differed between our countries. Additionally, we filled in each other&#39;s human practices surveys and passed them along to our schools, family members, friends, etc., allowing our surveys to reach a wider audience. On the aspect of proposed implementation, we mainly discussed how farmers would access and use our product from a practicality and financial perspective as well as how our product would impact the environment. For instance, we suggested to GEMS_Taiwan that they should consider how the released bacteria would impact organisms other than bananas, prompting them to work on containment of the bacteria. Towards the end of the iGEM journey, we reflected on what we were able to complete so far and what we planned to do in the future. Our team expressed our goal to commercialize our product, while GEMS_Taiwan aimed to partner with an institute so that they could further develop their product in order to successfully bypass biosafety regulations. We suggested that they look into whether they can release their chitinase into the environment without the live bacteria, since there are less regulations on releasing a protein into the environment compared to releasing a GMO. Finally, we gave each other feedback on our respective poster designs, infographics, and wiki page. We would like to give a huge thank you to GEMS_Taiwan for not only being a crucial partner of our iGEM journey, but for also being fun, supportive friends throughout this whole journey-a team we could hang out with as well as vent about trying to balance iGEM and high school. We canâ€™t wait to meet you in person at the Giant Jamboree and take a huge group photo!

                    We sub-cloned the bombolitin mRNA sequence from the venom of
                    the bumblebee
                    <i> Bombus ignitus</i> to pGEX-61 by process of DNA
                    synthesis. From this, we found out that bombolitin has a
                    2kDa mature peptide with approximately 18-amino acid
                    residues. Since we were concerned with the stability and
                    activity of the peptide, we decided to modify the peptide by
                    adding 3 amino acids which were phenylalanine, leucine, and
                    tryptophan at the C-terminal to test the stability and
                    activity. We then had to transfer these inserts separately
                    to PET32a for protein expression.

          Event: Inducing protein expression
          <br />
          Agenda: Transfer 1% of overnight culture to flask with 50 mL LB medium
          in 250 mL flask with 100 mg/ml Ampcilin. <br />
          Incubate it at 37 celsius at 250 RPM until OD (optical density)
          reaches 0.6 mU, indicating a good concentration of cells and protein. 
          <br />
          After OD reaches 0.6 mU, induce protein expression by adding 0.5mM
          IPTG. Incubate the solution for 4 hours at 37 celsius at 250 RPM.

          <br />
          Agenda: Harvest cells by centrifugation at 5000 RPM for 10 minutes at
          4 celsius first. Resuspend the cells with a resuspension buffer.
          <br />
          Afterwards perform sonication to break down cells and release protein.

          Event: Checking expression through SDS-page
          <br />
          Agenda: Run SDS page on the protein that was extracted from the day
          before. Denature the protein to separate them by sizes. Identify
          bombolitin by its expected size of 22.04 kDa.

          Date: 22nd August, 2022
          <br />
          Event: Purification of proteins to isolate Bombolitin
          <br />
          Agenda: Use FPLC to purify other proteins from the cells to isolate
          Bombolitin. Use a histrap column for this step, and discard
          flowthrough which will contain unwanted protein while Bombolitin will
          be stuck to the histrap column. Elute the column to collect the
          bombolitin.

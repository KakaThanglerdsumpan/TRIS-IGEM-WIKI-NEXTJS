                        Synthetic biology should not be feared, as it can very well be the driving force in the development of the world through the lens of science. From the information we have gathered from our human practices research, we have realized that there are still many people who do not trust synthetic biology due to their lack of understanding of it and what it entails. Our goal was to change this negative stigma many Thai people had about the use of synthetic biology. In order to ensure that we are able to reach as many age groups as possible, we decided to do separate activities all aimed towards different specific age groups, including elementary school students, middle school students, high school students, and lastly, adults.

                        In order to educate people on the negative effects of chemical pesticides, what they can do to combat it, and how our project will be beneficial to them, we decided to create an educational brochure. We agreed that handing out brochures when we went to survey people at Sammakorn market would be appropriate, since they could take it back home to read more about what our project entails and why they should be worried about the use of pesticides. As we had limited time surveying each individual, the brochure was a way for us to promote our message to them in a more in depth manner. Additionally, the brochure was also translated into Thai in order to reach a wider audience.

                        For this activity, we decided to work with third-grade students. The first thing we did was to present a fun google slides presentation about bacterial wilt, what pesticides are, and what they can do to combat the use of chemical pesticides. We introduced them to Ralstonia, which is a bacteria that causes bacterial wilt. We had to keep in mind that introducing what pesticides are and the dangers it entails can be a sensitive topic since the third graders could potentially become afraid of vegetables being exposed to pesticides. In order to spread our message while considering this, we decided to approach it in a fun way by always reminding them to always eat their vegetables so that they can grow up to be big and strong. We even dabbled a bit in on how we used synthetic biology in our project to try to make the world a better place. However, we werenâ€™t able to go into much detail, since we felt like it was not suitable for them yet. In the end, we presented the use of GMOs and why the negative stereotype that surrounds it is undeserved. After the presentation, we played Kahoot! with the students in order to check their understanding of what we had just taught. These third-grade students were very engaged, and they were able to answer all of the questions that we had prepared for them in the Kahoot!

                        After the Kahoot! game, we handed out the comics we did from the collaboration with iGEM Tec-Chihuahua for the students to color. From this, they were able to understand the main idea of our project, and we even had a little roleplay involving the students acting as the modified bombolitin antimicrobial peptide, Ralstonia, tomatoes, and farmers. From this activity, we got to see how the students understood and processed the things that we taught them.

                        For the middle school students, we worked with 7th graders. For this activity, we decided that we could go more in depth with synthetic biology. Similar to the educational outreach that we did with the elementary students, we had a google slides presentation showing the negative effects of chemical pesticides, while also introducing our project and synthetic biology as a concept.

                        This time, we emphasized the synthetic biology aspect, since they were at the age where the simple ideas of synthetic biology would be appropriate and not too overwhelming. We taught them about the basics of how genome editing works, and how it is a central part of synthetic biology.

                        We used simple analogies in order to make it easier to understand, such as comparing restriction enzymes to scissors used to cut plasmids and DNA ligase as the glue that sticks the insert and vector together. Furthermore, we talked about how genome editing has helped the world by modifying crops to gain resistance to pests and to have a longer shelf life. We hope that through our presentation, we were able to explain more about what synthetic biology is to the 7th graders, and combat the negative stigma associated with synthetic biology.

                        Additionally, we handed out our infographics from the collaboration with GEMS Taiwan for the students to read. This facilitated their understanding through some visuals, bettering their understanding of our project and the problems of pesticides. We even promoted iGEM to them in hopes of inspiring some of them to participate in the competition when they get to high school. To end our session, we played Kahoot! with the students. This time, the Kahoot! had more complicated questions for the middle school students to answer, as we taught them more complex content, in particular the parts that are involved in genome editing and how synthetic biology is beneficial to the world. Overall, it appeared to be a success, since the students seemed to enjoy it, and they asked a lot of engaging questions about our project. We hope to ignite a flame in them to be a part of iGEM themselves when they get to high school.

                        For this activity, we invited high school students, parents, and teachers to come listen to our presentation. This time, our presentation was mainly focused on the science aspects than the previous two presentations, since the audience consisted of those more knowledgeable about science (i.e biology students and science teachers).

                    Similar to the educational outreach in middle school, there was also a section of the presentation that we dedicated to educating people about synthetic biology. We corrected what we believed to be the biggest misconception that people have with synthetic biology: the dangers of having DNA from another organism in the product. From this, we approached the misconception by teaching them that all DNA is made up of the same four nitrogenous bases in every organism, meaning the transfer of DNA should not be a concern for them. In the end, we also had time for people to ask questions that they had about our project and about synthetic biology in general. The main questions asked were about how we plan to create an actual product from our findings, and how we know that our modified bombolitin antimicrobial peptide is actually safe to use. Keeping those in mind, we told them that we plan to extract the modified bombolitin from the E. coli that was used to produce the peptide, then put the peptide in a spray. 
                    This way, people would not have to worry about having <i> E. coli </i> on their crops.

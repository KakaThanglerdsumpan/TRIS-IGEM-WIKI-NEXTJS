            Our project ultimately aims to produce a product that could
            substitute the use of chemical pesticides to combat bacterial wilt.
            We found that bombolitin has the potential to effectively combat{" "}
            <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>. With this information, we genetically
            modified <i>E. coli</i>
            to produce modified bombolitin with increased hydrophobicity,
            resulting in increased efficiency. The modified bombolitin
            antimicrobial peptide will ultimately be the main composition of a
            pesticide-substitute product.

          At the current stage of our project, the modified bombolitin
          antimicrobial peptide has not been developed into a product yet.
          However, looking at the results of in-vitro testing, the modified
          bombolitin antimicrobial peptide is capable of inhibiting{" "}
          <i>Ralstonia</i>. Since there are currently no other effective ways to
          solve the problem of bacterial wilt, our project will be beneficial to
          producers of solanaceous crops. If developed into a product, the
          modified bombolitin antimicrobial peptide can be used in the form of a
          spray that will be applied into the soil since <i>Ralstonia</i> is a
          soil-borne pathogen. This way, the modified bombolitin antimicrobial
          peptide will kill the <i>Ralstonia</i> that is infecting the plants at
          its roots. The modified bombolitin antimicrobial peptide will be
          attracted to the gram negative cell membrane of <i>Ralstonia</i>,
          promptly disrupt the membrane structure, and ultimately cause cell
          lysis.

          When discussing the possibility of developing the modified bombolitin
          into a product, effectiveness and viability of the final product have
          to be considered.

          Firstly, taking into account that our potential product will be mainly
          consisting of peptides, there are specific temperatures and pH levels
          that need to be addressed. In order for the product to be effective,
          the peptide cannot denature. In response, heat shock proteins such as
          Hsp 60 can potentially prevent the denaturation of the peptide.
          Additionally, specified use of time for the ideal temperature will
          also be identified. However, further testing is required before
          finalizing all components.

        <p class="indented">
          Secondly, shelf life could be a big challenge if the modified
          bombolitin were to be developed into a product. When kept at room
          temperature, peptides could degrade within 24 hours, and -20°C is
          preferred for long term storage. However, -20°C might not be practical
          for the majority of farmers, since they would need constant access to
          a freezer.

          Finally, we have to consider commercial usage. Statistically, the
          demand of the product should be high. However, farmers may be
          skeptical of a genetically modified product which would significantly
          lower the demand. This may be solved through educating local farmers
          about genetically modified products and the effectiveness of said
          product. Additionally, the costs of production and the selling price
          of the product has to be determined. As we know, because of the way
          the product is being produced, through synthetic biology, the initial
          cost of the production would be high. Due to this, we would have to
          find a profitable competitive price for the potential product which
          would very well be more expensive than commercial chemical pesticides.

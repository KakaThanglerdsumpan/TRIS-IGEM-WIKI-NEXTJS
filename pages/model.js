          The indirect ELISA process that screens for a nanobody that binds best
          with the target bacteria, resulted in a clone that did not have any
          genes. A potential reason could be that the nanobody gene sent by
          Chulalongkorn University only had a vector, thus no protein coding
          sequence could be identified. Though, if more clones than just the
          twenty sent were screened, a nanobody with a gene and sequence would
          have been identified. Furthermore, the prepared phage library was old,
          therefore, the chances of identifying a nanobody gene was even lower.

          The bombolitin antimicrobial peptide is already established to be an
          antimicrobial peptide that has the ability to penetrate cell membranes
          and cause cell lysis. Our project aims to modify the structure of the
          bombolitin through the addition of three amino acids in order to
          increase the peptide&#39;s hydrophobicity and ability to penetrate the 
          <i>Ralstonia Solanacearum</i> cell membranes. There are various
          possibilities in which the three additional amino acids can be
          ordered. Although it is possible to express and perform in-vitro
          testing for all the combinations, it is much easier to check the most
          likely combinations through modeling and molecular docking.

          We utilized HADDOCK and Alphafold programs to model the peptide and
          perform molecular docking. After modeling the peptide structure, we
          end up with the target, bombolitin and protein target, and cell
          membrane. From this, we are able to find the specific bind, the type
          of cell protein, and binding affinity of our modeled peptide
          modification.

            Bombolitin with LLL Modification Structure Prediction

        <p class="indented1">
          As a result of altering the structure of the bombolitin through adding
          additional amino acids, the modeling and calculations from molecular
          docking shows that the modified version LLL is the structure with the
          highest efficiency. The enthalpy levels of the LLL modification is the
          lowest when compared to other versions. The more negative the
          enthalpy, the higher the affinity the peptide has in regards to being
          efficient in penetrating the membrane.

        <p class="indented1">
          By adding three amino acids and changing the structure in the program,
          the efficiency of the modified bombolitin is determined by the given
          polarity, hydrophobicity, and hydrophilicity. Visualizing the testing
          of the efficiency of the novel design through modeling before
          experimentation was very beneficial when taking the time constraints
          into consideration. However, lab experimentation is very essential to
          test the applications of the peptide. To conclude, the binding energy
          and the model have been utilized throughout the lab as reference.
